DRC - Decentralized Relay Chat

Replacement for IRC to work without central servers:
all communication is peer-to-peer where each peer is node in network
to relay messages to all other known peers.

Primary idea is that connection to any node can also relay to every other node in the network
thus making servers entirely unnecessary: all you need is connection to any node in the network.
